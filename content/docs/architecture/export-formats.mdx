## Format Comparison

| Feature | CSV | Excel | JSON |
|---------|-----|-------|------|
| **Human Readable** | ✓ | ✓✓ | △ |
| **Machine Readable** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓✓ |
| **File Size** | Small | Medium | Large |
| **Formatting** | None | ✓✓ | None |
| **Nested Data** | Flattened | Flattened | Preserved |
| **Compatibility** | Universal | Microsoft/LibreOffice | Programming |
| **Processing Speed** | Fast | Medium | Fast |

Legend: ✓✓ = Excellent, ✓ = Good, △ = Limited

## Data Consistency

All three export formats contain the **same enriched practice data**, extracted using the `extractPracticeData()` function:

- 20 standardized columns
- Validation + enrichment data merged
- Consistent field priority rules
- Same error handling

The only differences are:
- **Format/structure** (flat vs nested)
- **File type** and compatibility
- **Presentation** (formatting vs raw)

---

## Performance Considerations

### CSV Export
- **Fastest** to generate
- Smallest file size
- Low memory usage

### Excel Export
- **Medium** generation time
- Larger file size than CSV
- Uses xlsx library for formatting

### JSON Export
- **Fast** to generate
- Largest file size (includes all nested data)
- No formatting overhead

---

## Choosing the Right Format

### Choose CSV when:
- Importing into CRM or database
- Working with spreadsheet tools
- Need smallest file size
- Require universal compatibility

### Choose Excel when:
- Creating professional reports
- Sharing with business stakeholders
- Need formatted, readable output
- Working primarily in Microsoft Office

### Choose JSON when:
- Building API integrations
- Custom data processing required
- Need complete data structure
- Debugging or validation
- Archiving raw enrichment results
