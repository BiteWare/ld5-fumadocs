# LeadDesk 5 – Frontend Architecture

## Overview
LeadDesk 5 (LD5) moves from single‑practice processing to a batch‑only system. The frontend is a dedicated Next.js App Router application that manages CSV upload, job creation, practice-level status tracking, and CSV export of aggregated enrichment data.

## Core Principles
- **Batch-first UI**: All interactions operate at the job level.
- **Supabase-authenticated**.
- **REST-driven** via `/api/jobs`.
- **Shadcn UI + Zyris branding**.
- **Polling architecture** for real-time updates.

---

## Pages

### `/jobs`
Displays user job history with:
- Job ID
- Filename
- Status pill (running, not processing; error, not failed)
- Completed / total count
- Created timestamp

Implements:
- Search
- Sorting
- Loading skeletons

### `/jobs/new`
- CSV uploader (drag-and-drop)
- CSV preview (first 5 rows)
- File validation (CSV only)
- After upload → redirects to job detail

### `/jobs/[id]`
Real-time job page containing:
- Status pill
- Progress bar
- Export dropdown (CSV/Excel/JSON)
- Practice table (URL, status, error, timestamps)
- Auto-polling via `useJobPolling`

Polling interval: **3 seconds**
Stops when: `status = completed` or `error`.

### `/results`
Results list page displaying:
- All completed jobs
- Quick access to enriched data
- Filter and search capabilities

### `/results/[id]`
Individual result detail page:
- Detailed practice information
- Enrichment data display
- Export options

---

## Components
### `CsvUploader`
- Uses papaparse for client CSV preview
- Validates file extension & size
- Shows row count + file name
- Calls POST `/api/jobs`

### `JobHeader`
Contains:
- Job metadata (ID, filename)
- Status + progress bar
- Export button slot

### `PracticeTable`
Handles:
- Practice list
- Status badges
- Expandable errors
- Auto-scroll for large sets

### `ExportCsvButton`
Multi-format export dropdown component:
- Enabled only on `completed`
- Dropdown with three options:
  - Export as CSV → `/api/jobs/\{id\}/export`
  - Export as Excel → `/api/jobs/\{id\}/export-excel`
  - Export as JSON → `/api/jobs/\{id\}/export-json`

---

## Custom Hooks

### `useJobPolling(jobId, interval)`
Auto-refresh job data until complete:
- Polls job status at specified interval (default 3 seconds)
- Automatically stops when job reaches terminal state
- Returns job data and loading state

### `useJobData(correlationId)`
Fetch practice job with polling:
- Retrieves job data by correlation ID
- Includes automatic polling functionality
- Returns job details with practices

### `useUsers()`
User authentication operations:
- `signIn(email, password)` - Sign in user
- `signOut()` - Sign out current user
- `user` - Current authenticated user
- `loading` - Auth loading state

### `useToast()`
Toast notifications:
- Display success/error messages
- Auto-dismiss functionality
- Consistent notification UI

---

## Navigation
- Sidebar with: *Jobs*, *New Job*, *Results*
- Home redirects to `/jobs/new`

---

## API Client (`LD-API-Client.ts`)
Provides:
- `uploadCsvJob` - Upload CSV and create job
- `getJobs` - Fetch user's jobs list
- `getJobDetail` - Get job with practices
- `exportJobCsv` - Export as CSV
- `exportJobExcel` - Export as Excel
- `exportJobJson` - Export as JSON
- `searchPractices` - Search and submit practice
- `killJob` - Cancel job
- `redoJob` - Retry failed practices

---

## Data Flow
1. User uploads CSV in `/jobs/new`.
2. Frontend calls **POST /api/jobs**.
3. Backend creates job + practices.
4. Page redirects to job detail.
5. Polling fetches **GET /api/jobs/\{id\}**.
6. Final CSV exported from **GET /api/jobs/\{id\}/export**.
