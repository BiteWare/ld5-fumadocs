# LeadDesk 5 API

## Overview

The LeadDesk 5 API provides REST endpoints for managing batch enrichment jobs. Upload a CSV of practice identifiers, track processing progress in real-time, and export enriched data.

## Base URL

```
https://leaddesk.zyris.com/api
```

For local development:
```
http://localhost:3000/api
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using a Supabase JWT token.

Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_TOKEN
```

## Rate Limits

- API requests are scoped to authenticated users via Row Level Security (RLS)
- No hard rate limits, but bulk operations should use batch endpoints

## Response Format

All API responses use JSON format (except CSV exports).

### Success Response
```json
{
  "job_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "total_practices": 94
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid CSV format",
  "details": "Missing required columns"
}
```

## Workflow

1. **Upload CSV** - POST `/api/jobs` with a CSV file
2. **Monitor Progress** - Poll GET `/api/jobs/{id}` every 3 seconds
3. **Export Results** - GET `/api/jobs/{id}/export` when status is `completed`

## Job Statuses

- `pending` - Job created, no practices started
- `running` - At least one practice in progress
- `completed` - All practices finished
- `error` - Job-level failure

## Practice Statuses

- `pending` - Awaiting processing
- `url_complete` - URL normalized and validated
- `scraped` - Practice data extracted
- `aggregated` - Final enrichment complete
- `error` - Processing failed
