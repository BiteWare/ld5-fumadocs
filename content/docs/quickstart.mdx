## Get started with LeadDesk 5

Follow these steps to upload your first CSV and monitor the enrichment process.

### Step 1: Prepare Your CSV

Create a CSV file with practice identifiers (URLs or IDs), one per line.

```csv
practice_identifier
https://example-practice1.com
https://example-practice2.com
https://example-practice3.com
```

Each row should contain a practice website URL or unique identifier.

### Step 2: Upload Your Batch

1. Go to `/jobs/new` in the LeadDesk 5 interface.
2. Drag and drop your CSV file or click to browse. The system will validate and preview the first 5 rows.
3. Click "Create Job" to start processing. You'll be redirected to the job detail page.

### Step 3: Monitor Progress

The job detail page automatically polls for updates every 3 seconds.

You'll see:
- **Job Status** - Overall job state (pending → running → completed)
- **Progress Bar** - Visual representation of completion
- **Practice Table** - Individual practice status and errors

**Note:** Polling stops automatically when the job reaches `completed` or `error` status.

### Step 4: Export Results

Once the job is complete:

1. Click the **Export CSV** button on the job detail page
2. Download your enriched data with all aggregated fields
3. Review practice results including any errors

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Job Creation**: Your CSV is parsed and stored in the `enrichment_jobs` and `job_practices` tables.
2. **Dispatcher**: The n8n Dispatcher workflow is triggered to process practices in batches.
3. **Workers**: Three workers handle URL normalization, scraping, and data aggregation.
4. **Completion**: Database triggers automatically update job progress and status.
